            <p>Welcome to my Blog! On interesting days, I will be adding a section for one day, listing the events that have happened every month. I'll also be using this page to share some interesting stuff I found. I will also be linking archives for blogs every month and year that pass by.</p>

                <p>This is the first post of the page. I actually have some things to say too! <br><br>
                    Yesterday night was literally hell. It was like 26 degrees outside (felt like 30) and I couldn't sleep. (I had my window open, we didn't have AC on because I think the vents weren't cleaned) Luckily, the weather report said it was going to rain for 40 minutes, and I was so relieved. So I waited, and it was time. Guess what? IT DIDN'T EVEN RAIN. I ended up with 6 hours of sleep which is a new low this year.<br><br>
                    Anyways, I went to school, we had an annoying geography test that I definitely failed on, and we started the movies unit in French.<br><br>
                    Break passed, played Geometry Dash, nothing special, and as I'm writing this in Math class, I wanted to get an image from my Saved Images folder. Guess what? NOTHING. LITERALLY NOTHING. EVERYTHING WAS GONE! There wasn't anything in my Recycle Bin either. I'm pretty sure my drive suffered data loss after I installed Linux. RIP<br><br>
                    I didn't really have any important images there, but they were super awesome and cool, and cool looking timelines in Premiere, 1st in Kahoot, donations, all that stuff. But it was all gone, and I am sad.<br><br>
                    However, the good news is that our math test got pushed to Wednesday, and that's fun. Yay??<br><br>
                    Just got my Unit 3 math test back, and I got 100, 86, 86 and 52 (ðŸ’€) However it wasn't that bad, its overall 81 and my math overall OVERALL mark went from 85 to 86! GGs!!!!<br><br>
                    I am also proud to say that I got collapsibles working on here! This page has been finally uploaded to GitHub Pages.<br><br>
                    Anyways, that's it for today, goodbye! (I'm writing this the next day because i forgor)

                <p>Hey guys, I don't think this day is going to be interesting but I have something I want to show.<br><br>
                    Before that, I started the day biking to school with sore legs, and I arrived a bit late, but it was fine. <br><br>
                    Right now in Geography class, I just finished writing my Wikia article for this fictional universe called the G9DS. It has a big lore surrounding it, about the Grade 9 Discord Server, and I suggest you read up on the articles, but you should definitely check <a href="https://nengipedia.fandom.com/wiki/Anthony_Huang">my article</a> first.<br><br>
                    I wasn't expecting anything funny to happen today, but right after we left geo, my friend and some other people were walking in the hallways heading to our next classes, and our geo teacher passed by. My friend loudly said "AU REVOIR MADAME!" literally leaning outwards and yelling, and guess what? She looked at him dead in the eye soulless, ignoring him, saying nothing, and walking past him. IT WAS SO FUNNY LMFAO<br><br>
                    I also died at 93% on Nantendo during break, GG<br><br>
                    Other than that, I started decorating my Geometry Dash level, and I spent 4 hours only decorating about 5%.<br><br>
                    That's all from me for today. GOODBYE!
