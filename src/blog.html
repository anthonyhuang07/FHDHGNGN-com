            <p>Welcome to my Blog! On interesting days, I will be adding a section for one day, listing the events that have happened every month. I'll also be using this page to share some interesting stuff I found. I will also be linking archives for blogs every month and year that pass by.</p>

                <p>Hello guys, happy late Canada Day! This happened yesterday, but it was late and didn't have time to blog this.<br><br>
                    I beat the Ender Dragon! This is my first time beating it, but it wasn't solo, it was with friends. Here's the whole story. <br><br>
                    It started with the Li Institution gang wanting to speedrun Minecraft, and so we did. Hello56721 dropped out soon because of his parents, so it was just me and carpetmaker. We did lots of stuff, mining, etc. Got to the portal, then we spent the rest of the days bartering piglins for ender pearls. Eventually we got to the stronghold, and that's when newcomer to the Li Institution 2ndDeity joined, and we did our stuff. We got the portal, and we went in.<br><br>
                    It was crazy at first. We all died because we weren't coordinated, carpetmaker dropped out because it was late for him, so it was just me and 2ndDeity. We fought, but we realised a few minutes in that the AI of the Ender Dragon broke. It kept going the same pattern and we just kept shooting it and got it down to less than half health. <br><br>
                    We restarted the server and surely, the ender dragon went back to normal. You can watch the rest that happened below.<br><br>
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SXf29HY28D0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe><br><br>
                    (P.S. The hitboxes aren't hacks, they're built into Minecraft. Just press F3+B. Also, I'm the guy with the low quality mic, in case you haven't noticed.)<br><br>
                    So yeah, we beat the ender dragon, but there's one thing - we actually kinda cheated. You see whenever we died and lost our beds, we would ask the server owner (Hello56721) to teleport us back. It was kinda scuffed too, with him messing around with commands, so we've decided to redo it.<br><br>
                    That's it though, so bye bozos (and i also destroyed the server lmfao)
