I spoke French at school with friends and used it outside the house. At home, I speak Chinese (Mandarin) and English with my family, as my parents are immigrants from China.\n\nWhen I was 8, I moved to Ontario, where I used English on the daily. While I still took French Immersion classes at school, my French skills quickly started to deteriorate over time as I had no opportunity to use them in daily life. My interest in the language has returned in Grade 12, where I am planning to do the DELF B2.\n\nWhen I was 15, I started watching anime again, and as I was travelling to Japan that summer, I decided to learn a bit of Japanese. Currently, I have my JLPT N5 certificate. I am pretty bad at speakingâ€”as I have nobody to talk in Japanese with. The language has been really easy to learn thanks to my knowledge of Chinese. I am planning to take the JLPT N3 on December 2025. I keep up with my Japanese by studying with flashcards daily, watching Japanese Instagram Reels on my feed, as well as listening and singing Japanese music.",

                FHDHGNGN has no meaning. When I made the username, I was playing a mobile game called The Blockheads, where I needed a username. I ended up keyboard smashing. FHDHGNGN is actually the simplified result of that username after I forgot the original keyboard smashed username. The following is a history of all my usernames up to now:

                2015-2016: xboxgolfer

                Nowadays though, the FHD in FHDHGNGN kinda means 'Full HD' as in 1080p.
