        description: `Almost everything I know in this field is self-taught. I started programming at 8 years old with p5.js on Khan Academy, and later spent a lot of time Scratch. When I was 10, I learned basic web development with HTML/CSS.
        
        I made my return to programming at 13, after learning much about the tech world outside of just coding. I learned basic C to get back the vibe, then JavaScript, where I built my first side projectâ€”a Discord bot. Web development soon became my primary focus, and I later learned Python and TypeScript.
        
        I've participated in 5 hackathons, earning awards in 2 of them. I sometimes dabble in competitive programming, I primarily use Python and took part in the CCC Junior, where I scored 56/75.
        
        I am a soon-to-be Computer Science student in university. I hope to explore more about the fields of full stack and cybersecurity.`,

        I spent the first 8 years of my life in QuÃ©bec, where I spoke English and French on a daily basis (I lived in an Anglophone community in MontrÃ©al and indulged in mainly English media as a child). I spoke French at school with friends and used it outside the house. At home, I speak Chinese (Mandarin) and English with my family, as my parents are immigrants from China.\n\nWhen I was 8, I moved to Ontario, where I used English on the daily. While I still took French Immersion classes at school, my French skills quickly started to deteriorate over time as I had no opportunity to use them in daily life. My interest in the language has returned in Grade 12, where I am planning to do the DELF B2.\n\nWhen I was 15, I started watching anime again, and as I was travelling to Japan that summer, I decided to learn a bit of Japanese. Currently, I have my JLPT N5 certificate. I am pretty bad at speakingâ€”as I have nobody to talk in Japanese with. The language has been really easy to learn thanks to my knowledge of Chinese. I am planning to take the JLPT N3 on December 2025. I keep up with my Japanese by studying with flashcards daily, watching Japanese Instagram Reels on my feed, as well as listening and singing Japanese music.`,

Then in 2020, I watched JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, which became my favorite and the primary focus of my YouTube channel back then (I was a Roblox JoJo YouTuber). Unfortunately, due to some cyberbullying in that community (I was 12 at the time) I told myself I would never watch anime again.\n\nIn 2023, I was friends with people who were in the anime/manga scene, so I decided to give anime another try, watching Oshi no Ko (which just aired) and later Bocchi the Rock. These animes sparked my interest in learning Japanese.\n\nMy current favorites include Dragon Ball, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, PokÃ©mon, Steins;Gate, Bocchi the Rock!, and Horimiya.",

                FHDHGNGN has no meaning. When I made the username, I was playing a mobile game called The Blockheads, where I needed a username. I ended up keyboard smashing. FHDHGNGN is actually the simplified result of that username after I forgot the original keyboard smashed username. The following is a history of all my usernames up to now:
