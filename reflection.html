            <h2>1. What aspect of the course has been the most successful for you so far?</h2>
            <p>I think I did the best in Unit 3, which is data. I am into computers and programming, and data is a pretty big part of it. I know how to use spreadsheets effectively and make detailed graphs. I had a good understanding of the measures of central tendency and types of graphs to use for different use cases.</p>

            <p>For example, I know when to use a pie chart and when to use a scatter plot. One is to represent multiple different types of data and compare them, the other is to compare the same type of data with different values.</p><br>
            <h2>2. What thing have you learned in this class that you are the most excited about?</h2>
            <p>I thought the finance unit was fun, we started with the spent game, then activities with groups to compete against each other, which was a lot of fun. Money is a subject I'm not really good at, so it was nice to learn about it in a fun and engaging way.</p><br>

            <p>Other things we did in the unit were spreadsheets, which I know I'm good at, and coding, where I made another interest program with C. The unit was overall really exciting and fun.</p>
