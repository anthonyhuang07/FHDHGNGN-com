            <h2>1. What aspect of the course has been the most successful for you so far?</h2>
            <p>I think I did the best in Unit 3, which is data. I am into computers and programming, and data is a pretty big part of it. I know how to use spreadsheets effectively and make detailed graphs. I had a good understanding of the measures of central tendency and types of graphs to use for different use cases.</p>

            <p>For example, I know when to use a pie chart and when to use a scatter plot. One is to represent multiple different types of data and compare them, the other is to compare the same type of data with different values.</p><br>
            <h2>2. What thing have you learned in this class that you are the most excited about?</h2>
            <p>I thought the finance unit was fun, we started with the spent game, then activities with groups to compete against each other, which was a lot of fun. Money is a subject I'm not really good at, so it was nice to learn about it in a fun and engaging way.</p><br>

            <p>Other things we did in the unit were spreadsheets, which I know I'm good at, and coding, where I made another interest program with C. The unit was overall really exciting and fun.</p><br>
            <h2>3. What challenges have you encountered?</h2>
            <p>I think the most challenging thing for me is participation. Sometimes during activities, I'm not engaged and I don't end up participating. I get bored easily during activities and don't really give ideas, suggestions, or do the activities. This causes me to do slightly worse on final evaluations.</p><br>

            <p>One way to get me more engaged is being interested in the material. Stuff like coding will definitely get me interested in activities, but not everyone likes the same things, so other people might not get engaged. I think a good solution is to just use multiple different elements in activities, to get everyone engaged. This might not happen all the time though, so I'll just have to improve on my participating aspect. I need to reduce distractions, be interested, and concentrate.</p><br><br>
